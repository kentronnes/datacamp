# Reasons for Modeling: Estimating Relationships

# Another common application of modeling is to compare two data sets by 
# building models for each, and then comparing the models. In this 
# exercise, you are given data for a road trip two cars took together. 
# The cars stopped for gas every 50 miles, but each car did not need to 
# fill up the same amount, because the cars do not have the same fuel 
# efficiency (MPG). Complete the function efficiency_model(miles, 
# gallons) to estimate efficiency as average miles traveled per gallons 
# of fuel consumed. Use the provided dictionaries car1 and car2, which 
# both have keys car['miles'] and car['gallons'].

# [context figure]

# Instructions

# Complete the function definition for efficiency_model(miles, gallons)
# Use the function to compute the efficiency of the provided cars (dicts 
# car1, car2)
# Store your answers as car1['mpg'] and car2['mpg'].
# Indicate which car has the best mpg by setting best_car=1, best_car=2, 
# or best_car=0 if the same.


# Complete the function to model the efficiency.
def efficiency_model(miles, gallons):
   return np.mean( miles / gallons )

# Use the function to estimate the efficiency for each car.
car1['mpg'] = efficiency_model( car1['miles'] , car1['gallons'] )
car2['mpg'] = efficiency_model( car2['miles'] , car2['gallons'] )

# Finish the logic statement to compare the car efficiencies.
if car1['mpg'] > car2['mpg'] :
    print('car1 is the best')
elif car1['mpg'] < car2['mpg'] :
    print('car2 is the best')
else:
    print('the cars have the same efficiency')
